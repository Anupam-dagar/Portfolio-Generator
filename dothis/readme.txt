QUATRO is a creative pack of 404 pages. It features a clean and modern design which
is absolutely perfect for your blog, porfolio and agency websites. Quatro is available
in three variants: static, slideshow, and particle background and just like our other website
templates, it is fully responsive and retina ready which means it would look awesome, crisp 
and sharp on any device from mobile to desktop.

SUPPORT:
    
Since QUATRO is distributed for free, support is not offered. KARDS is coded according 
to current web standards and we did our best to make the template easy to use and modify.
If you have minimum web development experience, you can easily modify the template. 
However, If you're still new to HTML and CSS, I suggest that you visit the 
following tutorials:

 - http://tutsplus.com/course/30-days-to-learn-html-and-css/
 - http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/

These will teach you the essentials of HTML and CSS. In addition, if you want to include
jQuery in your skill-set, you can also check out these tutorials:
